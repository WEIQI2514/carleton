# Review Questions
# True/False

# 1. Using graphics.py allows graphics to be drawn in a Python shell window. F
#     Reference Page 86: "The GraphWin() function creates a new window on the screen. graphics.py is a module which is imported 
# 2. Traditionally, the upper-left comer of a graphics window has coordinates (0,0). T
#     Reference Page 88: "Traditionally, graphics programmers locate the point (0,0) in the upper-left corner of the window,"
# 3. A single point on a graphics screen is called a pixel. T
#     Reference Page 88: "A graphics winow is actually a collection of tiny points called pixels (short for 'picture elements')."
# 4. A function that creates a new instance of a class is called an accessor. F constructor
#     To create a new instance of a class, we use a special operation called a constructor. A call to a constructor is an expression that creates a brand 
#     new object."(Page 91) An accessor allows us to access information from the instance variables of the object(Page 92).

# 5. Instance variables are used to store data inside an object. T
#     Reference Page 92: Values are stored inside an object as instance variables.

# 6. The statement myShape.move(10 , 20) moves myShape to the point (10,20).F
#     Reference Page 93: All of the graphical objects have a move method specification move(dx, dy): Moves the object dx units in the x direction 
#     and dy units in the y direction.
# 7. Aliasing occurs when two variables refer to the same object. T
#     Reference Page 95: "This situation where two vairabiles refer to the same object is called aliasing."

# 8. The copy method is provided to make a copy of a graphics object. F clone
#     Reference Page 95: "The graphics library provides a better solution to copies or aliases; all graphical objects support a clone method 
#     that makes a copy of the object."

# 9. A graphics window always has the title "Graphics Window." F
#     Reference Page 98: The GraphWin constructor allows an optional parameter to specify the title of the window
#     Reference Page 113. GraphWin(title, width, height)
# 10. The method in the graphics library used to get a mouse click is read.Mouse. F
#     Reference Page 107: "When getMouse is invoked on a GraphWin, the program pauses and waits for the user to click the mouse somewhere in the graphics window."

# Discussion
#
# Q1. Pick an example of an interesting real-world object and describe it as a programming object by listing its data (attributes, what it "knows") and its methods 
#     (behaviors, what it can "do").
# A1. Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. You can look around you now and see many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television
#     set, your bicycle. These real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. 
#     For example, dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, and wagging tail). 
#     For example, cats have state (name, color, breed) and behavior( purring, grooming, kneading and climbing)
#     Bicycles have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, two wheels, number of gears) and behavior (braking, accelerating, slowing down, changing gears).
#
# Q2. Describe in your own words the object produced by each of the following operations from the graphics module. Be as precise as you can. Be sure to mention such things 
#     as the size, position, and appearance of the various objects. You may include a sketch if that helps.
#
# a) Point(130, 130)
# Constructs a point at x coordinate 130 and y coordinate 130, with 0,0 being located at upper left hand corner. Page 88
#
# b) c = Circle(Point(30,40), 25)
#          c.setFill("blue")
#          c.setOutline("red")
#  A blue circle with a red outline centered at (30,40) with a radius of 25
#
# Q2c) r = Rectangle(Point(20,20), Point(40,40))
#          r.setFill(color_rgb(0,255,150)
#          r.setWidth(3)
# A square 20 units on each side centered. filled with greenish blue and the outline is 3 pixels wide black line.
#
# d) l = Line(Point(100,100), Point(100,200))
#          l.setOutline("red4")
#          l.setArrow("first")
# A vertical dark red line with an arrow to the upper point， the bottom is (100, 200) and the length is 100

# e) Oval(Point(50,50), Point(60,100))
#
# An  vertical oval 
# f) shape = Polygon(Point(5,5), Point(10,10), Point(5,10), Point(10,5))
#      shape.setFill("orange")
#
# two orange cross lines of length of 5sqrt2 like a x
#
# g) t = Text(Point(100,100), "Hello World!")
#          t.setFace("courier")
#          t.setSize(16)
#          t.setStyle("italic")
#          t.draw(win)
#
# A message""Hello World!" centered at (100,100), displayed in an italic size 16 "courier" font
#
#
#  Q3.  Describe what happens when the following interactive graphics program runs:
#
       from graphics import *

       def main():                          # Defines the function named main() which contains the program
           win = GraphWin()                 # Creates a GraphWin object with "Graphics Window" default title and default size 200 x 200 pixels
           shape = Circle(Point(50,50), 20) # Constructs a circle object with the center at (50,50) and radius of 20 pixels
           shape.setOutline("red")          # Calls setOutline method of circle object named shape, seting its outline to the color red
           shape.setFill("red")             # Calls setFill method of circle object shape, it fills itself with the color red
           shape.draw(win)                  # Calls draw method of circle object named shape, it draws itself in graphics window object named win
           for i in range(10):              # Creates a counted loop that will iterate 10 times
               p = win.getMouse()           # Calls getMouse() method of graphics window object win, pauses program for user to click in win, returns mouse click as Point object,
                                            # which is assigned to the variable p (an event object)
               c = shape.getCenter()        # Calls getCenter() method of circle object shape, returns a clone of the center point of shape
               dx = p.getX() - c.getX()     # Assignment statement whereby variable dx is assigned the expression in the getX() methods of p and c are used to calculate the
                                            # difference along the x axis of the user's mouse click with respect to the center point of shape
               dy = p.getY() - c.get&()     # Assignment statement whereby variable dy is assigned a similar expression as dx, except this time it is for the Y axis
               shape.move(dx, dy)           # Calls the move() method of shape to move shape by the x distance referred to by dx and the y distance referred to by dy, thus
                                            # Moves the red circle shape moving its center point to the new coordinates encapsulated in the event object p
          win.close()                       # Calls the close() method of the Graphics Window variable win, closing the graphics window after the loop is finished.
                                            # Note that it will not be possible to see the final location of the circle. To do so, comment out win.close() or call on win's
                                            # getMouse() method to make win close after a mouse click.
       main()                               # Calls the function named main() to run the program
