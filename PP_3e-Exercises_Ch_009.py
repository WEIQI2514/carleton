### REVIEW QUESTIONS

## True/False

#  1. Computers can generate truly random numbers.  False
#  [Explanation: Computers cannot generate randomnness, though they can simulate/approximate it.p.286: "Of course, you know that there is nothing
#   random about computers; they are instruction-following machines."]

#  2. The Python random function returns a pseudo-random int. FALSE
#  [Explanation: p.287: "The random function can be used to generate pseudo-random floating-point values."]

#  3. Top-down design is also called stepwise refinement. True
#  [Explanation: p.300: "At each level, we began with a general algorithm and then gradually refined it into precise code. This approach
#  is sometimes called step-wise refinement."]

#  4. In top-down design, the main algorithm is written in terms of functions that don't yet exist. True
#  [Explanation: p.289: "Imagine that all the components you need to implement the algorithm have already been written for you. 
#  Your job is to finish this top-level algorithm using those components."

#  5. The main function is at the top of a functional structure chart. True
#  [Explanation: p.292: See Figure 9.1 as an example.]

#  6. A top-down design is best implemented from the top down. FALSE
#  [Explanation: p.301, see title for section 9.4, "Bottom-Up Implementation." "Just as designing a program one piece at a time is easier
#   than trying to tackle the whole problem at once, implementation is best approached in small doses."]

#  7. Unit-testing is the process of trying out a component of a larger program in isolation. FALSE
#  [Explanation: p.303: "We can continue this piecewise implementation, testing out each component as we add it into the code. Software 
#  engineers call this process unit testing. Testing each function independenly makes it easier to spot errors. By the time you get 
#  around to testing the entire program, chances are that everything will work smoothly."]

#  8. A developer should use either top-down or spiral design, but not both. False
#  [Explanation: p.306: "It is important to note that spiral development is not an alternative to top-down design.Rather, they are complementary approaches. 
#  When designing the prototype, you wil still use top-down techniques. In Chapter 12, you will see yet another  approach called object-oriented design."]

#  9. Reading design books alone will make you a great designer. False
#  [Explanation: p.306: "You can leaern about techniques by reading books like this one, but books can't teach when and how to apply them. That you have to
#  learn for yourself through experience. In design, as in almost anything, the key to success is practice."]
#  
#  10. A simplified version of a program is called a simulation. False
# [Explanation: p.304: "The initial stripped-down version is called a prototype."]
